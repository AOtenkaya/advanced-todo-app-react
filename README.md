# Advanced Todo App

I made this project on course to improve my React skills and get used to React environment.

This's a Kanban-like ToDo list. You can make CRUD operations on ToDo's and group them by using drag-and-drop.

Tech stack:

1. Building Tool: Vite - Vite is my favourite building tools due to it's speed and minimal configuration needs.
2. State Management: Redux, Redux Toolkit - Redux is no suprise here but I saw that Redux Toolkit provides less boiler plate code approach with more flexibilty so I wanted to try it on this project.
3. CSS: Tailwind - Since i already was trying to improve my tailwind skills on many other projects I wanted to take it here too.
4. Forms and Validation: Formik and Yup - I heard them a lot and they were highly recommended so i wanted to give them a try even if i didn't have complicated forms and validation needs here.
5. Drag and Drop: React-beautiful-dnd - I wanted to try a drag and drop package on React for a long time and decided this and didn't regret.
6. Multilanguage: i18next - Just like drag and drop I wanted to try multilanguage packages on React too. It was really close to i18n on Vue.
7. Deployer: gh-pages - There are many flows and guides exist on the web about deploying your project on GitHub but for a while I directly use gh-pages package to my deploys on my Vue and React projects and I strongly suggest it since it made it so solid and easy.
